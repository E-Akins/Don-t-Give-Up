# Don-t-Give-Up
Wholesome Jam 2020

This project was created in 2 1/2 days with a team of four for the first Wholesome Game Jam in 2020. The game is an endless runner that tasks the player with supporting the runner 
with power ups to get through obstacles. The player can move with WADS, make it rain with the J key and drop drinks with the K key.
